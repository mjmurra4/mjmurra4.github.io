<p>I won't lie to you, I don't really like cats.  They do their business indoors, they are mean, <strong>AND</strong> they can scratch up your furniture.</p>
<p>But people seem to love them! They think they are <em>so</em> cool. And they talk about them all the time. I just don't understand all the love</p>
<p>I do love learning about big cats though, my favorites(in no particular order) are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Lions</li>
	<li>Black Panthers</li>
	<li>Pumas</li>
</ul>
<p>Why are they better than housecats? Well in order:</p>
<ol>
	<li>They hunt their own food</li>
	<li>They poop outside</li>
	<li>They have never given me allergies</li>
</ol>
